#### Assignment
Read *Critical Questions for Big Data* and *Data Humanism*. Take notes and write 250-400 words addressing the prompts below. Remember to not repeat the texts, but reflect on them — I am interested in your **personal opinions, associations and ideas**. Submit your writing as described below and be prepared to participate in a discussion about the reading in class.

Prompts:
>The two texts mention the **"context"** of data. In your own words, what do they mean and why do they place such high importance to it? Can you **think of a situation** where the lack of context leads to **unintended/unfavorable consequences**?

>Both authors offer perspectives on using, or working with (big) data. **Imagine** they had a conversation with each other, in which points would they **agree or disagree**? Describe what makes you think that way.
